The main goal of the project is to contribute to a healthier life by improving users' posture.\n\nFeatures and Functions of the Project\n\n-Stance Analysis\n\nThe person using the app can analyze their posture by uploading photos to the app. Artificial intelligence algorithms process these images to identify posture points and determine whether the posture is correct. As a result of the analysis, it is determined whether there is any disorder in the user's posture.\n\n- Visual and Textual Feedback\n\nUsers are visually shown posture analysis results.\n\nPosture disorders are indicated graphically and detailed textual feedback is provided.\n\nUsers are given suggestions on how to correct their posture.\n\n- Suggestions and Exercises\n\nAI recommends personalized exercises to help users improve their posture. These exercises include specific movements aimed at correcting the user's posture disorders.\n\n- Per User Profile and Tracking\n\nA profile must be created in the app for the user whose photo is uploaded. Posture analysis results and recommendations are saved in the user profile. Users can track their past analysis results and progress.\n\n- Mobile Application & Tablet\n\nThe project is designed to work on mobile and tablet platforms. Users can analyze downtime and get feedback from any platform they want.\n\n- Purpose of the Project\n\n1 - Detection of Posture Disorders: Detecting users' posture disorders at an early stage.\n\n2 - Health Improvement: Enabling users to correct their posture and lead a healthier life.\n\n3 - Personalized Support: Providing personalized exercises and recommendations based on users' needs.\n\n- How does it work?\n\n1 - Image Upload: The user uploads a photo of their posture to the app.\n\n2 - Artificial Intelligence Analysis: The uploaded images are analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms identify posture points and detect posture disorders.\n\n3 - Feedback and Recommendations: The user is presented with posture analysis results and corrective suggestions.
