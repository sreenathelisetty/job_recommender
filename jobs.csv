At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.

Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.

We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.

What We're Looking For

Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small.

You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.

You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.

Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.

What You'll Do

Roboflow is hiring our first research engineer on the machine learning team to drive research initiatives that improve the growing suite of machine learning tools that underpin the Roboflow application. Roboflow is actively used by thousands of engineers and it is now imperative for us to keep our machine learning tooling at the cutting edge and to push the state of the art forward in the ways that we are uniquely positioned, given the breadth of computer vision applications that our product is capturing.

This role will involve adapting and extending open source machine learning technologies into usable and scalable software. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities.

Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.

📅 Within one week, you will…
• Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.
• Ship something substantial to an end user

📅 Within one month, you will…
• Onboard in person with your manager (you’ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)
• Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)

📅 Within six months, you will…
• Attend your first all company onsite
• Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.

Who You Are

You are a curious self-starter who wants to be part of an exceptional team, with a focus on using Roboflow's computer vision tools to impact and improve every industry.

On the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow’s training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects. We currently support the fine-tuning and deployment of object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation models. In the beginning, you will be executing on research initiatives that we have embarked on with partner organizations - centered around the Roboflow 100 object detection benchmark. As we discover results within these initial projects, the role will branch into your own curiosities in the intersection of computer vision research, AI research, and the Roboflow application. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably will not be a good fit.

We’re especially keen to add someone to our team who has deep experience and passion in the field and will help us live on the frontier of computer vision technology.

Skills

Skills - you should be familiar with many of these concepts and technologies and have built projects with some of them:
• Machine Learning Research: PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT, TFjs, YOLO, Transformers, COCO
• Backend + Cloud: node, Docker, python, Flask, pip, REST, AWS, GCP

We anticipate the role being focused 50% on machine learning research and 50% on implementing results of your research into the Roboflow application. You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. Your opinions on which research ideas we tackle and how we integrate them will be highly valued.

Example Projects
• Extending the capabilities of the Roboflow 100 auto-benchmark server
• Training a YOLOv8 Objects 365 checkpoint on YOLOv8 and evaluating how much it improves Roboflow 100 training results
• Writing a blog and example training notebook on DETA
• Assessing and implementing an auto-batching strategy for our training machines
• Surveying general open source OCR models and implementing one of them in the Roboflow inference server
• Assessing and implementing Neural Magic apis to deploy Roboflow models
• Training a general object detector across on Roboflow Universe datasets
• Evaluating capabilities of zero-shot object detection models for label assist
