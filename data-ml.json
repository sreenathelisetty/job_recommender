"job_description": "Who We Are\n\nOur mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.\n\nAt Roboflow, we\u2019re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow\u2019s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.\n\nOur team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: \u201cRoboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.\u201d We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\nPrimarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You\u2019re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You\u2019re eager to \u2018do the work,\u2019 big and small.\n\nYou\u2019re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.\n\nYou\u2019re motivated by the question, \u201cHow can I improve this?\u201d and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.\n\nMany Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nRoboflow is hiring our first research engineer on the machine learning team to drive research initiatives that improve the growing suite of machine learning tools that underpin the Roboflow application. Roboflow is actively used by thousands of engineers and it is now imperative for us to keep our machine learning tooling at the cutting edge and to push the state of the art forward in the ways that we are uniquely positioned, given the breadth of computer vision applications that our product is capturing.\n\nThis role will involve adapting and extending open source machine learning technologies into usable and scalable software. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities.\n\nOur core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within one week, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.\n\u2022 Ship something substantial to an end user\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within one month, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Onboard in person with your manager (you\u2019ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)\n\u2022 Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within six months, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Attend your first all company onsite\n\u2022 Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou are a curious self-starter who wants to be part of an exceptional team, with a focus on using Roboflow's computer vision tools to impact and improve every industry.\n\nOn the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow\u2019s training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects. We currently support the fine-tuning and deployment of object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation models. In the beginning, you will be executing on research initiatives that we have embarked on with partner organizations - centered around the Roboflow 100 object detection benchmark. As we discover results within these initial projects, the role will branch into your own curiosities in the intersection of computer vision research, AI research, and the Roboflow application. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably will not be a good fit.\n\nWe\u2019re especially keen to add someone to our team who has deep experience and passion in the field and will help us live on the frontier of computer vision technology.\n\nSkills\n\nSkills - you should be familiar with many of these concepts and technologies and have built projects with some of them:\n\u2022 Machine Learning Research: PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT, TFjs, YOLO, Transformers, COCO\n\u2022 Backend + Cloud: node, Docker, python, Flask, pip, REST, AWS, GCP\n\nWe anticipate the role being focused 50% on machine learning research and 50% on implementing results of your research into the Roboflow application. You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. Your opinions on which research ideas we tackle and how we integrate them will be highly valued.\n\nExample Projects\n\u2022 Extending the capabilities of the Roboflow 100 auto-benchmark server\n\u2022 Training a YOLOv8 Objects 365 checkpoint on YOLOv8 and evaluating how much it improves Roboflow 100 training results\n\u2022 Writing a blog and example training notebook on DETA\n\u2022 Assessing and implementing an auto-batching strategy for our training machines\n\u2022 Surveying general open source OCR models and implementing one of them in the Roboflow inference server\n\u2022 Assessing and implementing Neural Magic apis to deploy Roboflow models\n\u2022 Training a general object detector across on Roboflow Universe datasets\n\u2022 Evaluating capabilities of zero-shot object detection models for label assist\n\nWho You'll Be Working With\n\nOur team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.\n\nYou will directly be working with our Machine Learning Lead and a team of Machine Learning Engineers.\n\nWhere You'll Work\n\nRoboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best!\n\nWhen You'll Work\n\nRoboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you\u2019ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.\n\nWhat You'll Receive\n\nTo determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The target compensation for this role is $120,000 base salary.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:\n\u2022 A $4000 Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other Roboflowers.\n\u2022 A $350 Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high - speed internet at home or a co-working space.\n\u2022 Coverage of up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family.\n\u2022 Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision and Roboflow.\n\nTechnology\n\nOur goal is to build the world's best computer vision paradigm and corresponding code infrastructure to back our customer\u2019s applications. This means we handle a lot of challenging complexities like seamlessly ingesting dozens of data formats, processing millions of images per day, and deploying auto-scaling machine learning infrastructure that can handle our customers' most demanding training and deployment needs.\n\nOur core app sits atop Firebase with assistance from auto-scaling groups of Docker containers (for jobs like archiving datasets and training models). We also heavily lean on serverless infrastructure so we can gracefully deal with bursty traffic involved in manipulating datasets that can range anywhere from one hundred to one million images.\n\nOur machine learning infrastructure runs in AWS, with a few deployments spanning into GCP. We train and deploy various state of the art models in a variety of machine learning frameworks. All of our machine learning applications are closely integrated with the core Roboflow web application.\n\nWe also maintain a library of Colab notebooks our customers can use to train common computer vision models, a directory of public datasets, and a web of format specifications. We see building and supporting mini-projects like these that are helpful to the community at large as part of our role in democratizing computer vision.\n\nNot sure if this is you?\n\nWe want a diverse, global team with a broad range of experience and perspectives.

"job_description": "Who We Are\n\nOur mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.\n\nAt Roboflow, we\u2019re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 250,000 developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow\u2019s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.\n\nOur team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: \u201cRoboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.\u201d We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 23 million from Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\nPrimarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You\u2019re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You\u2019re eager to \u2018do the work,\u2019 big and small.\n\nYou\u2019re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.\n\nYou\u2019re motivated by the question, \u201cHow can I improve this?\u201d and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.\n\nMany Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nRoboflow is hiring our first research engineer on the machine learning team to drive research initiatives that improve the growing suite of machine learning tools that underpin the Roboflow application. Roboflow is actively used by thousands of engineers and it is now imperative for us to keep our machine learning tooling at the cutting edge and to push the state of the art forward in the ways that we are uniquely positioned, given the breadth of computer vision applications that our product is capturing.\n\nThis role will involve adapting and extending open source machine learning technologies into usable and scalable software. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities.\n\nOur core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within one week, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.\n\u2022 Ship something substantial to an end user\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within one month, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Onboard in person with your manager (you\u2019ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)\n\u2022 Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Within six months, you will\u2026\n\u2022 Attend your first all company onsite\n\u2022 Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.\n\nWho You Are\n\nYou are a curious self-starter who wants to be part of an exceptional team, with a focus on using Roboflow's computer vision tools to impact and improve every industry.\n\nOn the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow\u2019s training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects. We currently support the fine-tuning and deployment of object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation models. In the beginning, you will be executing on research initiatives that we have embarked on with partner organizations - centered around the Roboflow 100 object detection benchmark. As we discover results within these initial projects, the role will branch into your own curiosities in the intersection of computer vision research, AI research, and the Roboflow application. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably will not be a good fit.\n\nWe\u2019re especially keen to add someone to our team who has deep experience and passion in the field and will help us live on the frontier of computer vision technology.\n\nSkills\n\nSkills - you should be familiar with many of these concepts and technologies and have built projects with some of them:\n\u2022 Machine Learning Research: PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT, TFjs, YOLO, Transformers, COCO\n\u2022 Backend + Cloud: node, Docker, python, Flask, pip, REST, AWS, GCP\n\nWe anticipate the role being focused 50% on machine learning research and 50% on implementing results of your research into the Roboflow application. You certainly don't need to be an expert in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. Your opinions on which research ideas we tackle and how we integrate them will be highly valued.\n\nExample Projects\n\u2022 Extending the capabilities of the Roboflow 100 auto-benchmark server\n\u2022 Training a YOLOv8 Objects 365 checkpoint on YOLOv8 and evaluating how much it improves Roboflow 100 training results\n\u2022 Writing a blog and example training notebook on DETA\n\u2022 Assessing and implementing an auto-batching strategy for our training machines\n\u2022 Surveying general open source OCR models and implementing one of them in the Roboflow inference server\n\u2022 Assessing and implementing Neural Magic apis to deploy Roboflow models\n\u2022 Training a general object detector across on Roboflow Universe datasets\n\u2022 Evaluating capabilities of zero-shot object detection models for label assist\n\nWho You'll Be Working With\n\nOur team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.\n\nYou will directly be working with our Machine Learning Lead and a team of Machine Learning Engineers.\n\nWhere You'll Work\n\nRoboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best!\n\nWhen You'll Work\n\nRoboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you\u2019ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.\n\nWhat You'll Receive\n\nTo determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The target compensation for this role is $120,000 base salary.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:\n\u2022 A $4000 Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other Roboflowers.\n\u2022 A $350 Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high - speed internet at home or a co-working space.\n\u2022 Coverage of up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family.\n\u2022 Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision and Roboflow.\n\nTechnology\n\nOur goal is to build the world's best computer vision paradigm and corresponding code infrastructure to back our customer\u2019s applications. This means we handle a lot of challenging complexities like seamlessly ingesting dozens of data formats, processing millions of images per day, and deploying auto-scaling machine learning infrastructure that can handle our customers' most demanding training and deployment needs.\n\nOur core app sits atop Firebase with assistance from auto-scaling groups of Docker containers (for jobs like archiving datasets and training models). We also heavily lean on serverless infrastructure so we can gracefully deal with bursty traffic involved in manipulating datasets that can range anywhere from one hundred to one million images.\n\nOur machine learning infrastructure runs in AWS, with a few deployments spanning into GCP. We train and deploy various state of the art models in a variety of machine learning frameworks. All of our machine learning applications are closely integrated with the core Roboflow web application.\n\nWe also maintain a library of Colab notebooks our customers can use to train common computer vision models, a directory of public datasets, and a web of format specifications. We see building and supporting mini-projects like these that are helpful to the community at large as part of our role in democratizing computer vision.\n\nNot sure if this is you?\n\nWe want a diverse, global team with a broad range of experience and perspectives.
